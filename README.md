# Elyss Ancestries: Ulfrikin

This module contains the additional homebrew content for the PF2e system on Foundry.

The module contains an early version of the Ulfrikin ancestry to be used on Foundry. It'll be updated when any changes occur with the ancestry alongside a Pathbuilder json file to use it on that program as well.
